# {demo.name}

- Mark an individual React Server Component as _cacheable_ by adding the `use cache` directive to the top of the function definition.
- When a cacheable component is called with the same inputs, it reuses the cached result if it exists, otherwise it renders and caches the output.

{/* TODO: Add tiny code example with syntax highlighting */}

### Demo

- A product list component is annotated with `use cache`.
- An artificial one second delay is added to simulate a slow data request.
- Since the component is cacheable, the delay only happens the first time the component is rendered.
- `layout.tsx` and `page.tsx` aren't explicitly annotated with `use cache`, but Next.js infers they're static because they do not use any Dynamic APIs. If they started to, Next.js will guide the developer to either add `use cache` or a `<Suspense>` boundary.

### Notes

- This demo uses the experimental `use cache` directive and describes caching behavior once stable.
