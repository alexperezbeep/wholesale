# {demo.name}

- Mark an individual React Server Component as _cacheable_ by adding the `use cache` directive to the top of the function definition.
- When a cacheable component is called with the same inputs, it will re-use the same cache entry if it exists, or the component will be rendered and the result will be cached.

{/* TODO: Add tiny code example with syntax highlighting */}

### Demo

- A product list component is annotated with `use cache`.
- An artificial one second delay is added to simulate a slow data request.
- Since the component is cacheable, the delay only happens the first time the component is rendered.
- Since the the `layout.tsx` and `page.tsx` components are not annotated, they will be dynamic if they contain dynamic APIs, otherwise, they will be prerendered.

### Notes

- This demo uses the experimental `use cache` directive and describes caching behavior once stable.
