# Route Groups

- This example uses Route Groups to create layouts for different
  sections of the app without affecting the URL structure.
- Try navigating pages and noting the different layouts used for each
  section.
- Route groups can be used to:
  - Opt a route segment out of a shared layout.
  - Organize routes without affecting the URL structure.
  - Create multiple root layouts by partitioning the top level of the
    application.
