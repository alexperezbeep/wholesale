      <p className="mb-5 text-gray-700 text-lg">
        Before Luna Haven specialized in real estate wholesaling, we operated as a short-term rental and corporate housing company.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-5 text-gray-700">
        Over the course of our first year, we managed furnished housing units across Virginia for traveling professionals, relocating families, and digital nomads. Listings were hosted on platforms like Airbnb and VRBO. During that time, we generated over <strong>$12,000 in revenue</strong>, built operational systems, and oversaw all tenant, owner, and contractor communication.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-5 text-gray-700">
        That experience gave us a deep understanding of what homeowners deal with — from maintenance issues to tenant turnover — and showed us how important it is to have fast, flexible solutions when property ownership becomes a burden.

        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Why This Matters Today</h2>
        <p className="text-gray-700">
          Transitioning to wholesaling wasn’t random — it came from working in the housing space directly. That background helps us better serve sellers now by offering real, hands-on experience — not just theory.
