# Incremental Static Regeneration

- In this example, three posts fetch data using granular ISR.
- Caches responses are fresh for 60 seconds.
- Try navigating to each post and noting the timestamp of when the page
  was rendered. Refresh the page after 60 seconds to trigger a
  revalidation for the next request. Refresh again to see the
  revalidated page.
- Note that the fetch cache can be persisted across builds.
