# {demo.name}

- Mark a regular function as _cacheable_ by adding the `use cache` directive to the top of the function definition.
- When a cacheable function is called with the same inputs, it will re-use the same cache entry if it exists, or the function will be executed and the result will be cached.

{/* TODO: Add tiny code example with syntax highlighting */}

### Demo

- The data fetching function to get the list of products is annotated with `use cache`.
- An artificial one second delay is added to the function to simulate a slow data request.
- Since the function is cacheable, the delay only happens the first time the function is called.
- The `<ProductList>` component itself will be dynamic if it contains other dynamic APIs, otherwise, it will be prerendered.

### Notes

- This demo uses the experimental `use cache` directive and describes caching behavior once stable.
